## Desirable Functionlities

1. Users can upload their diagnosis. If the user is diagnosed as positive and has not yet recovered, the application will generate a QR Code. Other users who have installed our application can read nearby QR Codes and the cell phone will vibrate if there are infected users nearby.

2. Maybe in the future, when the technology is mature enough, users can test by themselves (Mobile kit, the sound of cough, etc.)

3. The application can automatically read and store the destinations the user has visited in the past one month, which can help the domain experts to do epidemiological source tracking investigation.

4. Users can provide supplies and food assistance to people in need through our platform

5. Users can add friends and the system will alert them if their family members or friends are infected.
